					The Revolution is in the Heart
				</h4>
				<p>
					We know that much of how we think comes from what we encounter and learn from our social environment. Knowledge as deeply socialized. But what about our feelings? Are our feelings our own unique experiences? Or are they shaped and constrained by social and cultural scripts? This talk explores how many of us live tightly scripted emotional lives, with dire consequences not only for ourselves but for those around us as well. And it explores the ways that our feeling lives are a critical dimension of what it means to be human--but also what it means to be political and ethical. In our feeling lives, we can both trace the ghostly presence of power and find new forms of political agency. The revolution is in the critical workings of the heart as much as anywhere else.

					The Purpose of Pain—Using Rage to Heal
				</h4>
				<p>
					Few of us have been raised in environments where we learned how to process emotional trauma. Finding a safe space to share our fears—sadness, anger, grief—is nearly impossible in a society that has little capacity to process painful emotions.<br /><br />But the purpose of pain is to help us grow, and it&rsquo;s rarely easy. To do such healing alone is nearly impossible, yet to share emotional pain is risky.<br /><br />“What if they think I&rsquo;m losing it and run the other way?” we think, as we put a smile on our face, secretly wishing it were safe to get real. Of course it&rsquo;s not safe and it never will be—not until we give ourselves permission to process and evolve through our pain.<br /><br />While we will never be able to stop our brains from rehashing the stories that prompt such pain, we can become aware of them. And that awareness of the difference between what&rsquo;s happening and the story we tell ourselves is our epicenter of personal power.<br /><br />This process of distinguishing the difference between our internal stories and the truth is at the center of personal freedom. It is the reason to meditate, chant, practice yoga, get in nature, play your guitar, sculpt your lawn, paint, or tinker with your car in the garage. It allows us to quiet the external noise long enough to hear what we&rsquo;re saying to ourselves.

					Determinants of Successful Cyber Security Policies and Strategies in Emerging Countries
				</h4>
				<p>
					What should countries take into consideration when developing their cyber security policies and strategies? What factors should be incorporated in order to increase the success of enforcing those policies? Dr. Karake will share the findings of her research, covered in her forthcoming book, “Enforcing Cyber Security in Emerging Countries.” Specifically she will cover the results of the content analysis of national cyber security strategies of tens of developing and emerging countries; she will also discuss the guiding framework which she developed for understanding the determinants of the quality and comprehensiveness of National Cyber Security (NCS) policies and strategies in those countries from a resource-based theory perspective.

					Starting A Movement Through Social Media
				</h4>
				<p>
					Ever wonder how #Blacklivesmatter become as big as it is now? It was all through social media. I started my magazine — Affinity Magazine— at 16 due to the lack of authentic teen voices in journalism on topics such as social justice and politics. Since then I have generated over 2 million views, over 400 teen writers, verified status on Twitter and over 39,000 followers. I have been featured on MTV's 2016 list of social media warriors and Business Insider's most impressive high school graduates list. My magazine has encouraged outlets to take teen writing seriously. Affinity Magazine is changing the world of digital media, and it's a movement teens are supporting 100%.
